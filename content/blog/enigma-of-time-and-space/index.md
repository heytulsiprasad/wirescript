I witnessed a scenic stretch of the Alps, at the dusk. And I got to think, I have met them afore. Soon I fathomed, they were a good fit for being spoken as Space-Time Fabric.

The way they looked made a difference. They all overlapped upon each other and if one looks straight from the façade, they seem as if, a posit lying deeply curved in between them. This vista can be interpreted in a typical way, and that’s what I did.

There were many of the tors in the stretch but is there any reason why they all looked similar and even their summit too rose up alike. One could say all those, peaks were identical. Although, one thing you would find common in them is their curve. And now, if we further interpret them as the space-time curve we’ll see there are some massive lies after every overlap. I alleged, they were so underlying in nature that, even our space-time would be the same having some bits common to each other. Only then we could quantize them.

I didn’t get much sleep either that night, so I had a great deal of time to think about a cool thought experiment, that I wrote further.

If we reckon, a rubber sheet having furrows and crumples all over them, which suited best to resemble a space-time pane. Let’s imagine, it has a massive star upon it and it curves the sheet by dint of its presence. Then, we call upon four people who pull it to resemble the expansion of time and space. We’ll soon get to see that the curvature that was earlier, lessens as it is expanding. Here, as per our conception, the star tends to come up due to the lessening of the curve beneath it. But we know, if the curve is less, then the mass should also be accordingly lesser. Then where, does the mass that was earlier in the account of the star escape? It’s radiating, mayhap so that leads to a certain fall in mass.

Nevertheless, the question still lies, is it so fundamental to nature that everything up on space-time, would be losing mass? Hereafter, there must lie a future far assorted from what mankind has ever, conceived.
