Like everything needs to be secured. But why is that, do you have a reason? No, but there’s one evergreen reason which is, what if you fall ill badly and never be able to work again? And that’s where our conversation ends half the time.

What if, you already had what you are looking for? What if, luxury or answers to your anxiety had always been there with you? Had there been every material thing you ever wanted, already present with you all the way, will it be any different? If yes, you’re not living for something rather you’re living for someone. And if you don’t know who someone is, then basically it’s the society, who had given the biggest contribution to our lives, which is letting us know what to do next.

Didn’t get it? They told you to join a school once you’re 3, take tuitions when you don’t get an A, give time to learn either dance or art as everyone’s doing them, join coaching once you’re 15 else you’d been told you would fall apart, get into a college, learn python (as it’s most widely used), never get a back in your degree, get a job and marriage and happily ever after. And the last few lines came exactly from what I’ve learned while living for someone called society, in the last decade.

I’ve been taught exactly whose footsteps shall I follow, in accordance with how much LPA one gets and how do doctors and brahmins keep earning all their lives, by their deed. It’s like choosing a human being who earns decently, and living his/her life all over again. The irony is, many who are reading this right now, have already been here or are going to be, like me, even though the storyline sucks. What else, can we do? We’re bound to stick, else we’ll be marked as a failure by the society itself, which never knew what you stood for!

This all came inside as I was lectured this morning about the importance of money. And I totally agree with it being important, but I agree more with a man’s **sole purpose** as important. And purpose might be a big word, but it simply means knowing what we’re doing.

If you say I’m going to buy an Audi, I really admire it but what is your why before buying Audi? Is it just for locomotion, which I can do with my bicycle? If not, what? If you stumble upon it, your answer basically is for society. To make sure you don’t fall off the bar you’re supposed to be at and give the notice you are able to buy an Audi.

What if I say, why not donate the money for the cause of saving the amazon wildlife, saving us from global warming, or more importantly investing in a worthy startup, for which I can line up a page of whys? But still, you’d preferably not want to because that doesn't show up like an Audi right? And that doesn’t carve your name to society. And those are the biggest lies our society taught us to give to ourselves.

I have a dream, that we’d be living one day irrespective of any bars predefined for us by anyone other than us, we’d be going after everything we are interested in, we’d be learning from everyone else not living their lives again, we’d be looking for answers that really give us meaning and inspire us to live our lives and that we’d live a life of purpose. I have this dream.
