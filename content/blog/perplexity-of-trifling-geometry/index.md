It is deemed, everything is determined by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust – we all dance intoned in the distance by an invisible piper. This seems so deep-seated in nature.

We are all familiar with music and melody, that even if we are subliminal while listening to it, we feel soothing or relaxing. It defines a meticulous harmony in nature. This harmony is what lies within each of us and the universe. This is what the cosmological principle lies on.

The cosmological principle envisages the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, on the large scales. Nonetheless, from views of causality, it’s hard saying the reason why this portent takes place.

It’s a very widely used notion which we have doomed to be true from centuries ago and from the remnants of the background radiation from the beginning of time, we have fortified this to be precise enough. But now one can grill, why does nature want to make the universe homogeneous?

This is where the enigma lies. Look, every moment there is incessant creation of matter and space and it goes on ever-increasing. The formation of gas clouds, stars, white dwarfs, and even ultra-byzantine neutron stars or black holes, takes place in our universe every moment. So, there is a proliferation in the matter, which makes the space intensely curved.

As a consequence, if they are left how they are, they will gravitate and wrench upon themselves to merge. This enigmatic upshot must be negated for the existence of the universe. And there’s a way which makes this and it’s what I imagined about.

_Let’s reckon, we have a string on which we dry all our clothes, provided the string is elastic. Now, what if we put more clothes in the middle of the string? The string will curve more at the center and of course, if the slope increases further it attracts the clothes at either end of the string towards the center. But now, we gradually, spread the clothes all over the surface and increasing spaces between each of them, then what happens? The curve almost lessens. The deep curvature breaks and distributes its curve all through the string which reduces overall curvature._

This is what happens with spacetime. Nature doesn’t want its matter to bend the fabric greater than a certain extent which causes intense attraction between celestial bodies. And thus to avoid merging between them by dint of more curvature, the fabric expands vigorously.

This is what slackens the excessive curve, which ends in making a flat geometry for our universe. Taking it yet further, there must lie some reason why nature loves flat geometry? Hence, underlying in the basic structural framework of the cosmos.
