We are in the midst of a momentous transformation in modern physics. As scientists look further and more clearly into space than ever before, we get a lot of mysterious and weird observations about the primordial stars and remainings of the superstitious big bang cosmology. Some, don’t even match with the predictions of our most iconic theories.

However, ever since the dawn of civilization, people have craved to reveal the enigmatic truth about their existence. Beginning from Friedmann’s classical big bang theory to Ashtekar and Martin’s loop quantum cosmology, each person has struggled to understand the underlying order of the world. Even now, we have various ideas on multiverse taxonomy.

So, we’ll here make a relation between the evolution of the biological unicellular organism to harmonize with the evolution of our universe and others, making it a wide chain of universes. A Multiverse.

## The Amoebic Universe.

It is rather arduous to contemplate the life cycles of a creature infinitely smaller than the universe itself, to tell us about the universe’s beginning. It starts with the creation of matter through collapse or random popping out of Feynman Electrodynamics.

When we precisely look upon an Amoeba, through all its stages then we come to know about its complexity of life structure. The first stage is its growth and development, and soon the organism expands itself. We thus could say the universe expands like an Amoeba. Then the procedure of ingestion comes which can possibly explain the boundary conditions of the universe. We can combine the stages of vacuole formation, assimilation, and absorption with some of the hidden aspects of the universe. As we can see, the rhythmic formation of matter and energy, near the boundary. We never know, if it will ever have pseudopodia, like stuff!

But next, we could explain the process of egestion with, harmonizing it with the black hole: the garbage dump. We are even looking behind at the properties of a black hole, whether it loses or gains entropy, and the relation of its area in a thermodynamical approach. But the superstitious fact comes when it binarily fuses or reproduces.

I assume that the tides turn here and somethings happen that break our existing rules of physics, which probably would and it divides itself into two! This gives a mother of our universe and this only happens at a specific point in space-time, from where the expansion would have begun. I swear, the mathematical complexity could unveil the mystery about the birth of a new, from an old universe. So, the question still remains…

Did Binary Fission Shape our Universe?
