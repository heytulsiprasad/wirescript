“Space-time says matter how to move, and matter says spacetime how to curve” This was what, envisaged by John Wheeler and his fellow scientists. However, there lies a destiny far more perplexing than moving, alone. If we closely contemplate space-time indeed, it articulates that it’s expanding at an intrinsic rate which, redshifts away the light coming from far off stars and galaxies. And this expansion of the fabric is what causes matter to gradually end.

Let’s get indulged in a thought experiment. For instance, we go to deep space and isolate a meek neutron star. It causes a vast curvature upon the space-time, which simultaneously keeps on expanding. This, in turn, causes the star to rise in space, as the bend tightens.

Over time the expansion is accelerating and thus our neutron star could have risen much. This phenomenon is quite generic, occurring in our everyday lives rather recurrently. If we tug on a lycra sheet from its edges, a sphere-like ball put above it would rise, too. This is what might also, be happening with our neutron star.

When it is grasped diligently, it is witnessed the curvature declines, which means some of its entity is missing. This entity is known to be, mass. It is a physical entity, causing the fabric to warp about each cosmic body. Accordingly, less curvature means lesser mass. This hence, conveys that the expansion of space-time holds the account of the loss of mass from every celestial body in this sort. This mass, perhaps in form of the gravity waves is coming from the body. The mass would keep on escaping until the tenet expansion of space-time make the curve almost flat. This is what our nature, craves to always have; a perfectly flat, geometry. At that point in time, in an ample flat universe, every article could be losing mass.

This loss in mass could be prior to what known as Hawking Radiation which is rather a meticulous conjecture of iconic theories of the twentieth century. This process could be, so vivid that our entire universe could be on verge of extinction even before a possible hypothetical Big Rip. This hypothesis could turn out to be the ultimate fate of our universe instigating, the End of Mass.
