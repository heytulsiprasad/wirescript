We are just an advanced breed of primates on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in one among a hundred billion galaxies. But ever since the dawn of civilization people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. And here are we now standing on a point of momentous transformation in modern physics by dint of the iconic theories practically realized by our ancestors of cosmology.

A Star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. So, we are all familiar with the stars we basically see in the night sky. But these little stars being little have sacrificed their lives for the evolution of mankind.

Let’s take, for instance, a pencil. Of course, it has graphite. It is simple to go to a market and give 10 rupees to buy one. It is all Carbon, with six electrons revolving around the central nucleus. This atom of C was formed billions of years back in the core of the stars but who gave the travel fare for the billion light-year journey, from the core of actually a star to us. It’s a spectacular explosion of a massive supergiant star, this may shine with a brightness of about 10 billion suns!  This much energy could be more than what released in the complete life cycle of our sun. So, this all makes the way for the 10 rupees pencil to come to our stationery shop.

The Universe is home to real monsters, we cannot see them but we know they are out there. We really can’t get anything bigger and stronger than a black hole.  The death of a star gives birth to the monsters of the night sky, called Black Holes.

They even suck in planets, stars, and even a complete solar system, whatever gets into their way, they suck in with a straw called gravity. Gravity which pulls down apples, keeps our feet on earth, and orbits our motion around the sun, is so intense at that place that even light bends and eventually swallowed.

Thus, it is our cycles of time, which says us about the beginning and working of our distant relatives, without whom our lives would have been practically impossible.
