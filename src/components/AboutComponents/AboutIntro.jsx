              Hey, I'm an aspiring software developer and I love to write, so
              much that I never needed a handwriting book in my childhood. I
              used to write about{" "}
              <a href="https://akidonscience.blogspot.com/2019/09/did-binary-fission-shape-our-universe.html">
                physics
              </a>
              , space, life, stuff that bugged me when I am alone (which I still
              do) and now mostly about tech and things I'm learning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One fine day, I wrote something on a piece of paper which got lost
              or maybe I kept somewhere I couldn't find, and then I realized
              that everything I've ever wrote would be lost someday without even
              seeing the light of day, and so I decided to make this website, to
              store everything I write. Also, you can subscribe to my newsletter
              to get more resources on frontend and design stuff. I also publish
              on <a href="https://dev.to/heytulsiprasad">Dev</a> and as a side
              note I now hangout most of the time on our{" "}
              <a href="https://bit.ly/wirescript">Discord</a>, which you can
              join to discuss stuff about tech, life, health or anything.

            You'll never know what you're capable of if you don't try, so get
            out of comfort zone often, you'll never regret it.
          </HeroText>
          <IntroText>
            <p>
              No matter how hard you try or what you've planned to overcome
              procrastination and acheive your goals, life always finds out a
              way to kick you back to your comfort zone, without you even
              knowing. So, be persistent in whatever you do or believe in it,
              because a river cuts through rock not because of its power, but
              because of its persistence.
