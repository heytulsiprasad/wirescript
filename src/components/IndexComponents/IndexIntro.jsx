          We all know how much essential it is to do something that we love, it
          helps us achieve more and become the best version of ourselves. But do
          we really follow that principle? Ask yourself. I used to think of it
          in my childhood, as most of the things we're taught in school had
          nothing to do with my life once I was out of school, but still
          everyday I had to go there. Now you'd be like, but that's essential
          then I'm sorry, I was never excited about who united the nomadic
          tribes of the Mongolian plateau in 11th century. But still I had to go
          to school anyway so that's when I started writing.
