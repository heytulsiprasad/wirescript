<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I used to write a ton of things on my Notion or even on paper, while studying new topics, but eventually they get lost somewhere on my computer or end up never being read again. This kept bugging me for way long, so that's why I decided to create my own space
on the internet and store all my writings and even share them with people that might want to read.

Here's why you should read this:

- They are original notes which I wrote after learning a concept
- It doesn't assume any prerequisites (without stating) as its wrote while I learnt from scratch
- Weekly new set of articles with useful links I come across while learning, delivered as Newsletter
